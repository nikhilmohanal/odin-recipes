            <p>In response to a request about how to make fresh squeezed orange juice. It takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from concentrate.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>4 oranges</li>


        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Lightly smack each orange on the counter. Cut each one in half. Squeeze into a glass. You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer.</ol>
